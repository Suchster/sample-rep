# Welcome to my practice repo
My name is Luis, i'm studying computer engineering in Mexico at IPN ESIME Culhuacan
currently on my seventh semester.

## What you will find here
I am new to github and I am finishing up some projects for school. 
I decided that storing and sharing my codes would be great since
github has been one of my sources for fixing my codes and stuff.

I might add a list later of what my projects were and what I think
are some important notes on.

Take in mind that some of these were my very first programs and some
were codes that were created in a few minutes or hours so they may not
be very polished.

Part of the reason i'll use this repo is for code testing and fixing
so I might be adding and removing things consistingly.

Sorry for my english, I haven't practiced it in quite a while.
Saludos desde Mexico!
